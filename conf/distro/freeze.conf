# general configuration file for freezing a distribution
#
# If freeze.conf is included (include distro/freeze.conf) in the
# distro conf file it will define BBFILES from the information in
# ${DISTRO}-bbfiles.conf or ${DISTRO}-package-dirs.conf (whichever
# exists in that order of preference.)
#
# NOTE that these conf files use ${PKGDIR} and therefore that
# variable must be defined before this file is included.
#
# First pull in the frozen definitions (if they exist)  The multiple
# includes allow the frozen file to be stored alongside local.conf
# and in the conf/distro directory - the former take precedence over
# the latter.
