Mono in OE is still very much a work in progress.
1.2.4 
  - is reported to work on MIPS.  
  - has floating point problems on ARM

1.2.5pre5
  - tested on ARM EABI.  Floating point issues have been worked around.

There is still a lot of packaging work that needs done to package the mono dll's for installation.
