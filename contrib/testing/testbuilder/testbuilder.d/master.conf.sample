### NOTES
# 1. All names in SETS variables should consists only of alphanumeric
# characters and underscores, and beginning with an alphabetic character or an
# underscore.
# i.e. [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
# My recommendation is not to use underscore as well
# 2. You can prefix any word in following 'list' variables
# with '!' do disable it.
# 3. All lists items will be processed in order they appears in list
