This is the OpenEmbedded Classic (OE-Classic) metadata repository.

WARNING: This version of OpenEmbedded is no longer supported or actively
developed - it has been replaced by a new model based upon
OpenEmbedded-Core (OE-Core). Users are strongly encouraged to migrate
to OE-Core as there will be no further updates to OE-Classic as part of
the OpenEmbedded project.

The OE-Core repository is available at:

  http://cgit.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/
  git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core

For further details on the differences between OE-Classic and OE-Core,
please see:
