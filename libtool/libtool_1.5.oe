DESCRIPTION = Generic library support script\
 This is GNU libtool, a generic library support script.  Libtool hides\
 the complexity of generating special library types (such as shared\
 libraries) behind a consistent interface.  To use libtool, add the\
 new generic library building commands to your Makefile, Makefile.in,\
 or Makefile.am.  See the documentation for details.  Libtool supports\
 building static libraries on all platforms.\
 Libtool supports generation of C, C++ and Java libraries.
